    /*
    This test simulates a reentrancy attack on the Bank contract.

    The Bank contract contains a vulnerable `withdraw()` function that performs an external call 
    using `.call{value: _amount}("")` before updating the user's balance. 
    This allows an attacker to recursively call `withdraw()` before their balance is reduced, 
    effectively draining the contract's funds.

    **Attack Flow:**
    1. The test first simulates multiple users depositing ETH into the Bank.
    2. The attacker is then given an initial balance and makes a legitimate deposit into the Bank.
    3. The attacker initiates the attack by calling `withdraw()`, which:
       - Triggers the attacker's `fallback()` function upon receiving ETH.
       - `fallback()` immediately calls `withdraw()` again, repeating the process.
       - This recursion continues until the Bank contract has no more ETH to withdraw.
    4. After the attack, we log the final balances to verify whether the attack successfully drained funds.

    **Expected Outcome:**
    - If the reentrancy vulnerability exists, the attacker should withdraw significantly more than their initial deposit.
    - The Bankâ€™s total balance should be close to zero.
    - The logs should show multiple executions of `fallback()`, indicating recursive withdrawals.

    If the Bank contract were properly secured using the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern or 
    a **reentrancy guard**, the attack would fail.
